## 🔄 How Role-Based Navigation Works

```
Login Page
    ↓
User enters credentials → API call to backend
    ↓
JWT Token + Role received → stored in localStorage
    ↓
Role = "admin"    → Redirect to /admin    (Admin Dashboard)
Role = "hr"       → Redirect to /hr       (HR Dashboard)
Role = "employee" → Redirect to /employee (Employee Portal)
    ↓
Protected Routes → If wrong role tries to access → redirect to Login
```
